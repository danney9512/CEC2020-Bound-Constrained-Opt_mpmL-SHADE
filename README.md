## Multi-population Modified L-SHADE for Single Objective Bound Constrained Optimization(mpmL-SHADE)

### About the authors:
 The program mpmL-SHADE is implemented by Yann-Chern Jou, Shuo-Ying Wang, Jia-Fong Yeh, and Tsung-Che Chiang.  ..
 If you have any question about the algorithm or program, please contact us.

### About the algorithm:
 We participated the Competitions of Real-World Single Objective Constrained Optimization in CEC Special Session, IEEE WCCI 2020. The paper of our algorithm is published in CEC2020. We extend a previous algorithm mL-SHADE by running the evolutionary process through multiple populations and adding dynamic control of mutation intensity and hyper-parameters. The whole population is partitioned into sub-populations by a random clustering method. Mutation intensity and hyper-parameters are adjusted based on the consumption of fitness function evaluations. Performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by ten benchmark functions in the [CEC2020 Competition on Single Objective Bound Constrained Optimization](https://github.com/P-N-Suganthan/2020-Bound-Constrained-Opt-Benchmark "link").

### About the program:
 We developed our program by C++ (std C++17). The development environment is Visual Studio 2019 under Win10(SDK: 10.0.18363)
 The detail of executation is shown down below:
